## Exercise 3: Update the web application to use the new SQL MI database

Duration: 30 minutes

With the `TailspinToys` database now running on SQL MI in Azure, the next step is to make the required modifications to the TailspinToys gamer information web application.

>**Note**: SQL Managed Instance has a private IP address in a dedicated VNet, so to connect an application, you must configure access to the VNet where Managed Instance is deployed. 

### Task 1: Deploy the web app to Azure

In this task, you are using the JumpBox VM and then using Visual Studio on the JumpBox, deploy the `TailspinToysWeb` application into the App Service in Azure.

1. Go to your Lab Environment details page and click on the **Go TO JUMPBOX-SUFFIX** button to launch the VM.

  ![SQL Server is entered into the Windows Start menu search box, and Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 17 is highlighted in the search results.](media/jumpnew.png "Windows start menu search")
  
2. Once VM launched, open File Explorer by selecting it in the Windows start bar.

3. In the File Explorer dialog, navigate to the ```C:\hands-on-lab``` folder and then drill down to ```Migrating-SQL-databases-to-Azure-master\Hands-on lab\lab-files```. In the `lab-files` folder, double-click `TailspinToysWeb.sln` to open the solution in Visual Studio.

    ![The folder at the path specified above is displayed, and TailspinToys.sln is highlighted.](media/windows-explorer-tailspintoysweb.png "Windows Explorer")

10. If prompted about how you want to open the file, select **Visual Studio 2019** and then select **OK**.

    ![In the Visual Studio version selector, Visual Studio 2019 is selected and highlighted.](media/visual-studio-version-selector.png "Visual Studio")

11. Select **Sign in** and enter your Azure account credentials from below.
    
    * Azure Usename/Email: <inject key="AzureAdUserEmail"></inject>
    * Azure Password: <inject key="AzureAdUserPassword"></inject>

    ![On the Visual Studio welcome screen, the Sign in button is highlighted.](media/visual-studio-sign-in.png "Visual Studio")


13. Once logged into Visual Studio, right-click the `TailspinToysWeb` project in the Solution Explorer, and then select **Publish**.

    ![In the Solution Explorer, the context menu for the TailspinToysWeb project is displayed, and Publish is highlighted.](media/visual-studio-project-publish.png "Visual Studio")
    
2. Select **Select Existing** and click on Publish button.

    ![The File Explorer icon is highlighted in the Windows start bar.](media/p6.png "Windows start bar")

17. Select **Publish** to start the process of publishing the application to Azure.

    ![The Publish button is highlighted on the Publish page in Visual Studio.](media/publish.png "Publish")

18. When the publish completes, you will see a message in the Visual Studio Output page that the publish succeeded.

    ![The Publish Succeeded message is displayed in the Visual Studio Output pane.](media/publish1.png "Visual Studio")

19. If you select the link of the published web app from the Visual Studio output window, an error page is returned because the database connection strings have not been updated to point to the SQL MI database. You address this in the next task.

    ![An error screen is displayed, because the database connection string has not been updated to point to SQL MI in the web app's configuration.](media/web-app-error-screen.png "Web App error")
