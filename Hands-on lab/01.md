## Exercise 1: Perform database assessments

Duration: 20 minutes

In this exercise, you use the Microsoft Data Migration Assistant (DMA) to perform assessments on the `WideWorldImporters` database. You create two assessments, one for a migration to Azure SQL Database, and then a second for SQL MI. These assessments provide reports about any feature parity, and compatibility issues between the on-premises database and the Azure managed SQL database service options.

> DMA helps you upgrade to a modern data platform by detecting compatibility issues that can impact database functionality in your new version of SQL Server or Azure SQL Database. DMA recommends performance and reliability improvements for your target environment and allows you to move your schema, data, and uncontained objects from your source server to your target server.

### Task 1: Configure the WideWorldImporters database on the Sql2008 VM

In this task, you do some configuration the `WideWorldImporters` database on the SQL Server 2008 R2 instance to prepare it for migration.

1. In the SQL-2008-SUFFIX VM, open **Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 17** (SSMS) by entering "sql server" into the search bar in the Windows Start menu and selecting **Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 17** from the search results.

    ![SQL Server is entered into the Windows Start menu search box, and Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 17 is highlighted in the search results.](media/start-menu-ssms-17.png "Windows start menu search")

1. In the SSMS **Connect to Server** dialog, enter `Sql2008-SUFFIX` into the Server name box, ensure **Windows Authentication** is selected, and then select **Connect**.

    ![The SQL Server Connect to Search dialog is displayed, with SQLSERVER2008 entered into the Server name and Windows Authentication selected.](media/ssms.png "Connect to Server")

1. Once connected, select **New Query** from the SSMS toolbar.

    ![The New Query button is highlighted in the SSMS toolbar.](media/ssms-new-query.png "SSMS Toolbar")

1. Next, copy and paste the SQL script below into the new query window. This script enables Service broker and changes the database recovery model to FULL.

    ```sql
    USE master;
    GO

    -- Update the recovery model of the database to FULL and enable Service Broker
    ALTER DATABASE WideWorldImporters SET
    RECOVERY FULL,
    ENABLE_BROKER WITH ROLLBACK IMMEDIATE;
    GO
    ```

1. To run the script, select **Execute** from the SSMS toolbar.

    ![The Execute button is highlighted in the SSMS toolbar.](media/ssms-execute.png "SSMS Toolbar")

### Task 2: Perform assessment for migration to Azure SQL Database

In this task, you use the Microsoft Data Migration Assistant (DMA) to assess the `WideWorldImporters` database against Azure SQL Database (Azure SQL DB). The assessment provides a report about any feature parity and compatibility issues between the on-premises database and the Azure SQL DB service.

1. On the sql2008-SUFFIX VM, launch DMA from the Windows Start menu by typing "data migration" into the search bar, and then selecting **Microsoft Data Migration Assistant** in the search results.

    ![In the Windows Start menu, "data migration" is entered into the search bar, and Microsoft Data Migration Assistant is highlighted in the Windows start menu search results.](media/windows-start-menu-dma.png "Data Migration Assistant")

2. In the DMA dialog, select **+** from the left-hand menu to create a new project.

    ![The new project icon is highlighted in DMA.](media/dma-new.png "New DMA project")

3. In the New project pane, set the following:

    - **Project type**: Select **Assessment**.
    - **Project name**: Enter ```ToAzureSqlDb```
    - **Assessment type**: Select **Database Engine**.
    - **Source server type**: Select **SQL Server**.
    - **Target server type**: Select **Azure SQL Database**.

    ![The new project settings for doing a SQL Server to Azure SQL Database migration assessment are entered into the dialog.](media/dma-new-project-to-azure-sql-db.png "New project settings")

4. Select **Create**.

5. On the **Options** screen, ensure **Check database compatibility** and **Check feature parity** are both checked, and then select **Next**.

    ![Check database compatibility and check feature parity are checked on the Options screen.](media/dma-options.png "DMA options")

6. On the **Sources** screen, enter the following into the **Connect to a server** dialog that appears on the right-hand side:

    - **Server name**: Select ```Sql2008-SUFFIX```.
    - **Authentication type**: Select **SQL Server Authentication**.
    - **Username**: Enter ```WorkshopUser```
    - **Password**: Enter ```Password.1234567890```
    - **Encrypt connection**: Check this box.
    - **Trust server certificate**: Check this box.

    ![In the Connect to a server dialog, the values specified above are entered into the appropriate fields.](media/dma2.png "Connect to a server")

7. Select **Connect**.

8. On the **Add sources** dialog that appears next, check the box for **WideWorldImporters** and select **Add**.

    ![The WideWorldImporters box is checked on the Add sources dialog.](media/dm1.png)

9. Select **Start Assessment**.

    ![Start assessment](media/dm2.png "Start assessment")

10. Review the migration assessment to determine the possibility of migrating to Azure SQL DB.

    ![For a target platform of Azure SQL DB, feature parity shows two features that are not supported in Azure SQL DB. The Service broker feature is selected on the left and on the right Service Broker feature is not supported in Azure SQL Database is highlighted.](media/dm3.png "Database feature parity")

    > The DMA assessment for migrating the `WideWorldImporters` database to a target platform of Azure SQL DB shows two features in use that are not supported. These features, cross-database references and Service broker, prevent WideWorldImporters from being able to migrate to the Azure SQL DB PaaS offering without first making changes to their database.

### Task 3: Perform assessment for migration to Azure SQL Database Managed Instance

With one PaaS offering ruled out due to feature parity, perform a second DMA assessment against Azure SQL Database Managed Instance (SQL MI). The assessment provides a report about any feature parity and compatibility issues between the on-premises database and the SQL MI service.

1. To get started, select **+** on the left-hand menu in DMA to create another new project.

    ![The new project icon is highlighted in DMA.](media/dma-new.png "New DMA project")

2. In the New project pane, set the following:

    - **Project type**: Select **Assessment**.
    - **Project name**: Enter ```ToSqlMi```
    - **Assessment type**: Select **Database Engine**.
    - **Source server type**: Select **SQL Server**.
    - **Target server type**: Select **Azure SQL Database Managed Instance**.

    ![The new project settings for doing a SQL Server to Azure SQL Database Managed Instance migration assessment are entered into the dialog.](media/dma-new-project-to-sql-mi.png "New project settings")

3. Select **Create**.

4. On the **Options** screen, ensure **Check database compatibility** and **Check feature parity** are both checked, and then select **Next**.

    ![Check database compatibility and check feature parity are checked on the Options screen.](media/dma-options.png "DMA options")

5. On the **Sources** screen, enter the following into the **Connect to a server** dialog that appears on the right-hand side:

    - **Server name**: Select ```Sql2008-SUFFIX```.
    - **Authentication type**: Select **SQL Server Authentication**.
    - **Username**: Enter ```WorkshopUser```
    - **Password**: Enter ```Password.1234567890```
    - **Encrypt connection**: Check this box.
    - **Trust server certificate**: Check this box.

    ![In the Connect to a server dialog, the values specified above are entered into the appropriate fields.](media/dma2.png "Connect to a server")

6. Select **Connect**.

7. On the **Add sources** dialog that appears next, check the box for **WideWorldImporters** and select **Add**.

    ![The TailspinToys box is checked on the Add sources dialog.](media/dm1.png "Add sources")

8. Select **Start Assessment**.

    ![Start assessment](media/dm2.png "Start assessment")

9. Review the SQL Server feature parity and Compatibility issues options of the migration assessment to determine the possibility of migrating to Azure SQL Database Managed Instance.

    ![For a target platform of Azure SQL Database Managed Instance, no issues are listed.](media/dma-feature-parity-sql-mi.png "Database feature parity")

    ![For a target platform of Azure SQL Database Managed Instance, a message that full-text search has changed, and the list of impacted objects are listed.](media/dm4.png "Compatibility issues")

    >**Note**: The assessment report for a migrating the `WideWorldImporters` database to a target platform of Azure SQL Database Managed Instance shows no feature parity and a note to validate full-text search functionality. The full text search changes do not impact the migration of the `WideWorldImporters` database to SQL MI.

10. The database, including the cross-database references and Service broker features, can be migrated as is, providing the opportunity for WideWorldImporters to have a fully managed PaaS database running in Azure. Previously, their options for migrating a database using features, such as Service Broker, incompatible with Azure SQL Database, were to deploy the database to a virtual machine running in Azure (IaaS) or modify their database and applications not to use the unsupported features. The introduction of Azure SQL MI, however, provides the ability to migrate databases into a managed Azure SQL database service with *near 100% compatibility*, including the features that prevented them from using Azure SQL Database.
